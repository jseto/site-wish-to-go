## Things to do

### La Sagrada Familia <WishWidget	country="ES"	city="Barcelona"	activity="La Sagrada Familia" picture="https://wish-to-go.com/images/for-wish-to-go/spain/sagrada-familia-counter-barcelona-isaac-CmLrmQNYtII-unsplash.jpg" label/>

An obligatory stop in Barcelona is to visit the Sagrada Familia and calculate the time left to finish it. The church is also designed by Antoni Gaudí, like La Pedrera, and is considered one of the most visited monuments in Spain. It is said, that when finished it will be the tallest church in the world. For this reason and for its architectural art, it is worth visiting.

### Parc Guell

On the upper side of the Gracia district is the Park Güell, where the modernist spirit of Gaudí is once again reflected: undulating forms, geometric games, and colorful mosaics. It has an extension of 17 hectares. This park is considered one of the must-see places in Barcelona. 

### La Pedrera - Casa Milà

Although Barcelona is characterized by the many modernist buildings that Antoni Gaudí has left us. Take a trip to the golden age of the city by walking along Passeig de Gracia, remember to look up and see the modernist buildings. The most famous is La Pedrera (Casa Milà) and next to it, on the other side of Paseig de Gracia street, there is **Casa Batlló** <WishWidget	country="ES" city="Barcelona" activity="Casa Batllo"></WishWidget>
