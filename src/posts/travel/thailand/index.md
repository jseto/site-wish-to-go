Thailand is a huge country full of unexpected experiences. It is the most popular destination in Southeast Asia. People go there for many reasons, a flourish economy, stunning landscapes, tropical beaches, nice people or excellent food. It is a very easy country to move around. Transport infrastructures are pretty good and modern, and they have a long well established tourist industry. This makes the traveller feel like at home despite the language, the ancestral traditions or the exotic countenance of their people. They call themself _The Country of Smiles_, and they are not wrong. Since they are children they are taught to smile nicely by parents, uncles and friends. So be ready to enjoy a unique experience that many visitors will never forget.
