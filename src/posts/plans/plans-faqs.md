### Is it safe to give you my data?

We are very jealous to safeguard private data. In fact, we do not keep sensitive data about you. All banking or credit card data is stored in our reputed payment gateway partners. We even don't have access to your financial data.
The only personal data that we store is your name and your email address in order to be able to identify you.

### What do you do with my data when I cancel my subscription?

When you cancel, we save your information for 14 days in case you need to access it. After that, we delete all of your associated data. To delete financial information you have to contact directly with the payment gateway that you used to register with us.

### Do I have to sign a contract?

By using our services, you adhere to our [Terms and Conditions of Use](/legal/terms/) and the [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy-policy/). You can change or cancel your subscription plan at any time, and we will not charge you in the next billing period.
